        <div>
            <h3>Biography</h3>
            <p>Hi there! I'm a 30 year old living in Piteå, which is a town in northern Sweden. I currently work as an backend software developer but I want to learn more about the frontend part of programming.</p>
            <p>I studied in Linköping University for three years, but then I moved back up north, this is where I feel like home.</p>

            <h3>Academic Interests or Hobbies</h3>
            <p>Academically, as I earlier mentioned I graduated Linköping University. Although I've felt that frontend development seems more fun than backend, where my main focus at the moment is Java.</p>
            <p>So here I am attending this course in hopes of learning a bit more of the works.</p>
            <p>On my free time I spend way too much time by the computer, both for gaming and trying to develop new skills in my line of work. When I'm not benched infront my monitor i like to hang out with friends, chill with my cat or workout at the gym.</p>

            <h3>Future Goals</h3>
            <p>My future goals, academically is to become a better developer, to learn more about frontend and either work full-time as a fullstack or frontend developer, only time will tell where I'll end up.</p>
